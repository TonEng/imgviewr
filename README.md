# imgviewr
I did not like the image previewer of OSX so I decided to build one myself.
program is written in python (3) and uses tkinter. 
One can increase the speed of the slideshow by clicking on the top half of the displayed image; decrease by click on the bottom half of the displayed image. After setting the slideshos checkbutton on, select the next, previous or random buttons to start the slideshow. The slideshow speed (approx. seconds delay) is shown in the slideshow button.
